Cleaning old pictures before scanning them into a digital format
is a delicate job, but one that can be done well if you are
careful and take your time. Whether you are a scrapbook
enthusiast or you simply want to preserve an old photo before it
completely disintegrates, creating digital copies of your
treasured old pictures is a great way to save them for
posterity. Follow these steps to clean old pictures before
scanning.

Difficulty: Moderately Challenging

Instructions

Things You'll Need:

	White cotton editing gloves
	
	Soft brush or canned air
	
	Cotton Towel
	
	Photographic Emulsion Cleaner
	
	Pec-Pads

Step 1

Put on a pair of white cotton editing gloves. This is an
inexpensive investment, but an important one. You can get a pack
of a dozen for under 10 dollars at local developing studios, or
online at a depot site such as FilmTools.com.

Step 2

Inspect the old picture you intend to scan into a digital
format. Determine if it is simply dusty, if it has old adhesive
or pen marks on it or if there is any milky residue present. The
amount of cleaning that needs to be done depends on how dirty the
photo actually is. Surface dust and dirt particles can be removed
easily with some light brushing, deeper damage will need special
chemicals to properly clean the old picture before scanning.

Step 3

Place a cotton towel onto a flat tabletop. Lay your old
photograph in the center of the towel. Be sure the table top
doesn't contain any liquids or other substances that could
potentially damage your picture.

Step 4

Brush any lose dirt off of your old picture with a very
soft-bristled brush. Make sure you brush from the center out
towards the edges, otherwise you will be moving dirt particles
from one edge all the way across the picture, increasing the
chance of damaging the photograph. Another dusting option is to
use canned air, however, these sometimes exert too much pressure
for delicate work. If your picture is in need of a deeper
cleaning, continue onto the next step.

Step 5

Go to a reputable developing studio or search online and purchase
photographic emulsion cleaner (PEC) and PEC pads to apply the
cleaner. These can be expensive, from 25 to 65 dollars, depending
on how many you need, but it is also the best way to save an old
picture that has become soiled.

Step 6

Spray the PEC once or twice onto a PEC pad. Then, using a
circular motion, lightly wipe your photograph. The spray dries
almost immediately, as it is not water based, making it safe for
archival photo work. The remaining dirt, marks or residue should
come right off. If you are left with a hazy finish from the
emulsifier, try repeating the process with less spray.
