  review it) 
 )

  (store them in a thing called photos)
  (allow annotations)
  (have this one of the special modes)
  (mark the back of the images some kind of stamp)
  )

 (create video instruction for the whole system, showing how to
  scan documents, and how to organize your filing cabinets, etc.
  (The video should be shot in segments and rendered from
   workflows.  that way, any adjustment of the script material,
   such as when the software improves, will be easily
   re-rendered) )

  and organize them in the first place)

  the fix-timing stuff for how to assert it.)

  and have it figure out what is what)

 (have the ability for it to detect, when scanning in a multipage
  document, whether it thinks the doc has already been scanned in,
  and alert the user before they rescan the whole thing.  Of
  course, it could simply be a doc that has the same initial
  pages, so have to verify with the user - show the document it
  has to see if it is the same, then again, could differ only in a
  few words the user might not notice)

  person, etc)

 (completed (add backup feature that exports everything to a tar.gz file or something))

 (have menu options that change based on the type of object, so
  for instance, if an object is classified as a bill, it has an
  option to pay and maybe also an option to mark paid)
 (add the ability to splice apart an image or pdf into smaller
  documents, for when say you scan multiple unrelated items
  together.  Also add the ability to break on pages.)

(http://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/pdf2gimp2pdf.htm)

(each document has a particular folder that you want to put it in - possibly even keep the order of the papers in the folder correct)
(deal with document physically missing (as in cannot be found) in the cabinet)
(deal with document removal and replacement into the cabinet)

(add a manual classification system for documents, which has
 context sensitive menus, for instance, bills have the option to
 drag down and mark as paid)

(add a feature for marking bills/invoices, etc paid, or payment
 received, preferably with some kind of pointer to proof of it)
(add an option for online bill pay - where it recognizes who the
 bill is from etc and sets everything up, just asking for your
 permission
 (also- should learn that $10000 is unusual and have a
  kind of auto-security to prevent ridiculous transactions, etc -
  someone has probably written standards for this.))

(when you load an existing document, it should figure out what
 class it is and load that...)

(all the functions should be called in the right way)
(on loading, it shouldn't recopy things)

 already scanned document)

(add approximate searching to account for OCR errors)

(write a little gui)

(make thumbnails of each page)
